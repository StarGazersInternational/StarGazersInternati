# StarGazersInternati
StarGazers International began as an idea to help protect StarGazers Internationally.
As a method to certify individuals as not participating in any harmful or detrimental activities.
StarGazers International aim to assemble, discuss, and StarGaze without discrimination as according to
Equal Employment Opportunity guidelines.
I have decided to use StarGazers International as the name of my "Virtual" music group.
As such, I entitle myself, StarGazers Internati, for I am One of Many!
Visit My Personal Description for a brief introduction of myself also.
Aside from musical endeavors my most recent ambitions revolve around 
Non-Fungible Tokens, Roblox,and DogeCoin.
