StarGazers International began as an idea of connecting StarGazers Internationally.
Whatever Your Approach...(i.e. Astrology, Astronomy...etc.)
We All Share the Heavens and for Many of Us the Daytime becomes a Veil...
The Night allows Us to StarGaze via the naked sky/eye/...

StarGazers International, has transcended to also become a representation
for my Musical endeavors. As a yet, (soon), to be released Musical Artist 
I look forward to sharing my ideas and expressing myself via the music outlet. 
Music for Me is a way to express myself and also give food for thought.
